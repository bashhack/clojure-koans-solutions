# Solutions to Clojure Koans 

---

:warning: :warning: :warning:

## Important 
This repository contains my isolated solutions to the famed [functional-koans/clojure-koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans).

To run these solutions at the REPL - within the context of the Clojure Koans testing suite - visit my fork at [bashhack/clojure-koans](https://github.com/bashhack/clojure-koans). Once there, follow the steps outlined in the section ***Running the Koans***.

If you're looking to create your own solutions to the problem set, start by forking the original repository hosted by [functional-koans](https://github.com/functional-koans) at [functional-koans/clojure-koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans).

## Credits

These exercises were started by [Aaron Bedra](http://github.com/abedra) of
[Relevance, Inc.](http://github.com/relevance) in early 2010, as a learning
tool for newcomers to functional programming. Aaron's macro-fu makes these
koans clear and fun to use and improve upon, and without Relevance's
initiative, this project would not exist.

Using the [koans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koan) metaphor as a tool for
learning a programming language started with the
[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) by [EdgeCase](http://github.com/edgecase).
